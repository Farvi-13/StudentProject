Student Project
    
        Purpose: To create a resource to support student initiative in creating something new!

        Discussion: Many students want to try themselves in one direction or another, but creating something on their
            own is a big challenge and in the course of implementing what they have in mind, the student fades away.
            Therefore, he/she needs a team, but we will encounter a problem because the student does not know absolutely
            everyone and there is not much choice for him/her and therefore the chance of successful implementation
            decreases. Our task is to create a resource that will resemble job vacancy sites, where a student can propose
            his project that he would like to implement but needs a team. At the same time, a student who wants to meet
            new people or gain experience in team development or similar will be able to find enterprising guys and join
            them.

        Bottom line: the resource gives students opportunities to network, develop, express themselves and have their
            ideas implemented, namely a team.

        The future: the resource could become a platform for the whole university, where students from different
            faculties can create something more or less large-scale together.
